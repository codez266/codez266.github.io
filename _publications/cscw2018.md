Quality control is critical to open production communities like Wikipedia. Editors enact quality control onthe borders of Wikipedia to review edits (counter-vandalism) and new article creations (new page patrolling)shortly after they are saved. In this paper, we describe a long-standing set of inefficiencies that have plaguednew page patrolling by drawing a contrast to the more efficient, distributed processes for counter-vandalism.To effect better page review distribution, we develop an effective automated topic model based on a labelingstrategy that leverages a folksonomy developed by subject specific working groups in Wikipedia (WikiProjecttags) and a flexible ontology (WikiProjects Directory) to arrive at a hierarchical and uniform label set. Weare able to attain very high fitness measures (macro ROC-AUC: 95.2%, macro PR-AUC: 74.5%) and real-timeperformance using word2vec-based features on the intial draft versions of articles. Finally, we present aproposal for how incorporating this model into current tools will shift the dynamics of new article reviewpositively.
