A software engineering project to make teaching graph algorithms easier through the use of simulated illustrations of graph algorithms. The core model includes an abstract graph simulator built on d3 using which individual graph algorithms can be simulated with minimal code additions. Customizations include coloring the graph, controlling speed and manual state travel of the graph.
