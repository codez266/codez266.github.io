Hello, I'm Sumit. I'm a computer science student currently in IIT Patna, India.
I'm interested in developing for web as well as diving into the world of algorithms. I've recently developed a strong interest in open source and I'm a contributor to mediawiki open source software.
This blog is mainly my thoughts related to web and anything else that may interest me in computer science.

Thanks for reading!
