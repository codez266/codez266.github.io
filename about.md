Hello, I'm Sumit. I'm a bachelors in Computer Science from IIT Patna.
I'm interested in Machine Learning with a focus towards NLP. I'm also passionate
about technology in general and believe that technology in any form has the power to
transform human lives for better or for worse. I'm especially inclined towards
the use of AI in the present age for better of lives. I'm also a Wikipedia
volunteer and my MediaWiki userpage is [this](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Sumit.iitp).

I was previously a member of the NLP Lab at IIT Patna under [Prof. Pushpak
Bhattacharya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) where I started most of my
work in NLP and Machine Learning and presently I'm an independent researcher
contributing to open source projects(primarily Wikipedia) and applying to labs doing
research in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP.

Currently, I'm doing a lot of open-source research with [Wikipedia's AI
team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Scoring_Platform_team). All my research contributions are documented at my [user page](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Sumit.iitp/Research).

This blog is mainly on my thoughts related to Computer Science and anything else that may interest me apart from computer science.

Thanks for stopping by! For any questions, you can leave comments on the posts
or on my MediaWiki user [talk page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Sumit.iitp).
