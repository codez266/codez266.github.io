Thank you dear visitor for stopping by! I am a final year PhD candidate at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research focus and interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

I develop adaptive AI systems that <span style="color:deeppink;">enable people reason under risk and uncertainty in complex decision-making scenarios</span> by modeling their underlying thought processes—not just their observable behaviors. For example, in education, inferring students' conceptual gaps requires reconstructing their mental models from their learning trajectories, not just identifying surface-level mistakes. I borrow from <span style="color: deeppink">cognitive science and probabilistic machine learning</span> to design AI with experts' mental model to improve Human-AI interaction. By modeling people's latent cognitive states, my methods <span style="color: deeppink">improve reasoning of AI systems beyond observed behaviors</span>, improving overall learning efficiency and accuracy. I bring in strong computational and model building skills from my prior industry experience to build systems for Human-AI interaction and my training in HCI allows me to conduct real world study for improving Human-AI interaction. For example., I recently built a bayesian network from a massive dataset of 3M records to model personal information and using it to study personalization - privacy trade-off. The following three broad directions describe my research focus and future vision.

1. <b>Desiging computational models that can understand and improve expert decision-making</b> <span style="color:deeppink;">(AI to critique not obey)</span>: Furthering the design of computational models that can <span style="color:deeppink;">understand and reason about experts' decision processes, and how they reason about and balance principles in their decisions</span>. For example, understanding how instructors balance providing the answer versus guiding students in tutoring scenarios.

2. <b>Designing Human-AI interaction to support and continuously improve through interaction with experts:</b> Designing user interfaces and interactions that naturally support and augment experts' work practices, and enable AI to <span style="color:deeppink;">unaimbiguously understand user goals, and mental processes during interactions</span> to improve AI systems during use.

3. <b>Advancing the responsible use of AI in helping people become experts:</b> Designing methods to support equitable education and advancing the responsible use of AI in education by  <span style="color:deeppink;">studying decision process of educators and designing technologies that leverage established pedagogical principles</span> to augment educators's expertise.

I have strong connections with the Wikipedia open-source community. I have contributed to the codebase that powers the mobile version of Wikipedia, and I had also administered their Google Summer of Code internship program in 2016,17. For my services I was nominated by Wikimedia Foundation to attend Google summer of code mentor summit in 2017, and invited to present my research at the monthly Wikimedia research showcase in 2021. Currently, I contribute to the Wikipedia community in research, such as serving on the program committee of Wiki Workshop, Wikipedia's annual research workshop.
