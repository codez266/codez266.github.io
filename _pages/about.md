I'm a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India where I'm working on [Project Sankie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sankie/) in the Applied Sciences Group. I did my bachelors in Computer Science from IIT Patna(2017).

Previously, I was a member of the NLP Lab at IIT Patna under [Prof. Pushpak
Bhattacharya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). I have also worked with **Dr. Aaron Halfaker** at [Wikimedia's AI team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Scoring_Platform_team) to solve a relevant problem of backlogs in new page review through AI. I'm presently working on improving the efficiency of software engineering processes through ML as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India.

I'm an aspiring researcher interested in Machine Learning and System building to solve challenging problems especially around socio-technical environments. I'm also interested in ML for high performance systems.
I'm passionate about technology in general and believe that technology in any form has the power to
transform human lives for better or for worse. I'm interested in pursuing a PhD in the above domains.
