Hello, I'm Sumit. I'm a bachelors in Computer Science from IIT Patna, and currently a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India.
I'm interested in Machine Learning and System building to solve challenging problems. I'm also passionate
about technology in general and believe that technology in any form has the power to
transform human lives for better or for worse. I'm especially inclined towards
the use of AI in the present age for better of lives. I'm also a Wikipedia
volunteer and my MediaWiki userpage is [this](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Sumit.iitp).

I was previously a member of the NLP Lab at IIT Patna under [Prof. Pushpak
Bhattacharya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). I have also worked with Dr. Aaron Halfaker at [Wikipedia's AI team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Scoring_Platform_team)to solve a relevant problem of backlogs in new page review through AI. I'm presently a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India where I'm working on improving software engineering through ML.

This blog is mainly on my thoughts related to Computer Science and anything else that may interest me apart from computer science.

Thanks for stopping by! For any questions, you can leave comments on the posts
or on my MediaWiki user [talk page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Sumit.iitp).
