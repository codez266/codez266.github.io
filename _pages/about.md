Hi, I'm a graduate student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I work with [Nikola Banovic](http://www.nikolabanovic.net/) in the domain of applications of AI to human-centered areas.

In my engineering hat, I enjoy building systems and the last mile optimizations that go with putting something in practice.

In my research hat, I enjoy working on challenging problems from the the algorithmic lens, and how we can use algorithms to solve novel problems. 

More details about me in these hats can be found on my [CV](/cv) page
