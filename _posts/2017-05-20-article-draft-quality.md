I'm quite excited to write about my most recent volunteer work on , "Automatic classification of "__Article Draft Quality__
that I'm doing in collaboration with
Wikimedia Foundation's AI team that helps develope Machine Learning models to counter
vandalism on Wikipedia and research on improving editor's and reader's
expereince. Well, too much of interesting things to turn around!
For any technical details and update, refer to the [wiki page](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Automated_classification_of_draft_quality)

## Background

Wikipedia is a very large collaborative encyclopedia and a very strict [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Quality_control) is
followed for each and every edit of its articles. As a result, a team of
volunteers work relentlessly for [oversight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editorial_oversight_and_control) and control the quality through collaboration.
An important aspect of this quality control is page deletion when deemed
necessary and deletion has a strict set of [guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy).

Apart from systematic deletion, Wikipedia also has a [criteria for speedy
deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion)
where administrators have broad consensus to bypass deletion discussion at their
discretion and immediately delete Wikipedia Pages. The page on speedy deletion
defines comprehensively the aspects under which these have to be carried out,
but few are noteworthy:

* __G10__: Pages that disparage, threaten, intimidate, or harass their subject or some other entity, and serve no other purpose
* __G11__: Unambiguous advertising or promotion
* __A7__: No indication of importance (people, animals, organizations, web content,
  events)

Its _interesting_ to note that these are the properties which are most
frequently cited when deleting pages under the category __"vandalism", "spam", and
"attack"__

## The Problem

Since administrators have an overriding authority in deleting articles under the
above mentioned clauses, it often happens that _drafts created by new editors_ get
deleted because of their inexperience regarding Wikipedia standards and hence
Wikipedia loses such editors out of sheer _demotivation_. 

## The Solution

The project __Automatic Classification of Article Draft Quality__ addresses
precisely this aspect of article deletion by providing a Machine Learning model
to suggest draft categories to administrators so that both the work of
administrators is reduced and new editors get some time to improve their work.

I'm quite excited to be part of such a project! More updates here, or on the
wiki.
